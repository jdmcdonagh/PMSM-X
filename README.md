# PMSM-X

PMSM-X is an electromagnetic model of a permanent magnet synchronous motor built within the finite element platform [FEniCS-X](https://fenicsproject.org) using the Python interface. 

This model constituted my BEng dissertation titled "Development of a 3D Low-Frequency Electrical Machine within the Finite Element Platform FEniCS-X for Exascale Multi-Physics Simulations".
